# URL Shortener
The URL shortener allows users to shorten long URLs for easier sharing and tracking. It provides a simple web interface for entering URLs, generating short URLs, and viewing the list of all shortened URLs. Additionally, the application tracks the number of times each short URL is accessed. The project demonstrates the use of Mongoose for database interactions and EJS for templating the web interface.
